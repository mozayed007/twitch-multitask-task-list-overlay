# 🎬 OBS Setup Guide - Fixed for 1920x1080

## ✅ Layout Fixed for OBS

Your overlay is now **properly configured** for 1920x1080 resolution in OBS Browser Source.

---

## 📐 What Was Fixed

### **Problem:**

- CSS was using scaling (`* 2`) causing layout to break
- Viewport wasn't fixed to 1920x1080
- Components weren't positioned correctly for OBS

### **Solution:**

- ✅ Fixed viewport to 1920x1080
- ✅ Removed problematic scaling
- ✅ Added `obs-fix.css` with proper grid layouts
- ✅ Set fixed dimensions for all components
- ✅ Ensured transparent background works in OBS

## 🎯 OBS Browser Source Settings

### **Step 1: Add Browser Source**

1. In OBS Studio, click **+** in Sources
2. Select **Browser**
3. Name it: `Task List Overlay`
4. Use these **EXACT** settings:

```
☑️ Local file: YES
📁 Local File: F:\Streaming-business\twitch-multitask-task-list-overlay-main\index.html

Width: 1920
Height: 1080

FPS: 30

☑️ Shutdown source when not visible: NO
☑️ Refresh browser when scene becomes active: YES
☐ Control audio via OBS: NO

Custom CSS: (leave blank)
```

5. Click **OK**

### **Step 1b: Keep Token Refresh Running**

The OBS source is a static local file. It can read `_auth.js` and save refreshed tokens in OBS browser storage, but it cannot safely store your Twitch Client Secret or rewrite `_auth.js`.

For automatic token refresh, keep the local backend running while OBS is open:

```powershell
Set-Location F:\Streaming-business\twitch-multitask-task-list-overlay-main\backend
python main.py
```

Store backend secrets in `backend/.env`:

```txt
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_app_client_id
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
TWITCH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/callback
BACKEND_HOST=127.0.0.1
BACKEND_PORT=8000
```

Leave `_auth.js` pointed at the local helper:

```js
twitch_auth_refresh_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/refresh"
```

If the backend is not running or `_auth.js` has no refresh token, the overlay falls back to the invalid-token modal.

### **Step 2: Position the Overlay**

The overlay will now **fill the entire 1920x1080 canvas**. You can:

- **Keep it full screen** for dashboard layouts
- **Crop it** (Alt+Click drag) to show only part
- **Scale it down** (Ctrl+drag corner) for smaller overlay
- **Position it** anywhere in your scene

## 💡 Pro Tips for OBS

### **Tip 1: Use Transform for Different Scenes**

Right-click source → **Transform** → **Edit Transform**

- Set different positions/scales per scene
- Save as source properties (not scene-specific)

### **Tip 2: Crop for Gameplay**

1. Hold **Alt** and drag edges to crop
2. Remove empty space around active panels
3. Common crops:
   - Show only timer: Crop to 300x300
   - Show only tasks: Crop to center 600px
   - Bottom bar: Crop top 720px

### **Tip 3: Add Filters for Polish**

Right-click source → **Filters** → Add:

- **Color Correction** - Adjust brightness/contrast
- **Opacity** - Make it more subtle (try 85-90%)
- **Blur** - Slight background blur (1-2px)
- **Chroma Key** - Usually not needed (already transparent)

### **Tip 4: Multiple Instances**

Add the same source multiple times:

1. Right-click source → **Duplicate**
2. In each scene, set different layout via `!layout` command
3. Use scene-specific show/hide

### **Tip 5: Keyboard Shortcuts Work in OBS**

When browser source is active:

- **Ctrl+Shift+T** - Theme menu (works in OBS browser)
- **Ctrl+Shift+L** - Layout menu (works in OBS browser)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Layout looks broken?**

✅ **Solution:**

1. Check browser source dimensions are **1920 x 1080**
2. Right-click source → **Properties** → Verify settings
3. Right-click source → **Refresh**
4. Try: `!layout compact` then `!layout split`

### **Text is too small?**

✅ **Solution:**

1. The overlay is designed for 1920x1080
2. If OBS canvas is different size, scale the source:
   - Right-click → Transform → Scale
   - Or hold Ctrl and drag corner

### **Components overlapping?**

✅ **Solution:**

1. Reset layout: `!layout minimal`
2. Clear localStorage:
   - F12 in OBS → Console
   - Type: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Press Enter
3. Refresh source
4. Set layout again: `!layout split`

### **Theme not applying?**

✅ **Solution:**

1. Verify `obs-fix.css` is loaded:
   - F12 → Network tab → Look for obs-fix.css
2. Check `themes.json` is in root folder
3. Try: `!theme minimal` (always works)
4. Refresh browser source

### **Transparent background not working?**

✅ **Solution:**

- The overlay IS transparent by default
- If you see a background:
  1. Check OBS → Settings → Advanced
  2. Set Color Format: NV12
  3. Restart OBS
- No need for Color Key filter!
